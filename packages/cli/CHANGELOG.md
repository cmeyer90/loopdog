# @loopdog/cli

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- [#16](https://github.com/cmeyer90/loopdog/pull/16) [`abf7954`](https://github.com/cmeyer90/loopdog/commit/abf79546327b8ee2664746d2838a5293d4934d29) Thanks [@cmeyer90](https://github.com/cmeyer90)! - `loopdog upgrade` now also re-syncs the scaffolded controller workflows' version
  pins, so an attached repo stops silently running a stale (and possibly buggy)
  controller after a Loopdog release.

  loopdog is zero-infra and can't push updates into an adopter repo, so a caller
  workflow only stays current if it **floats** on the major tag the release
  pipeline keeps moving (`uses: …/reusable-*.yml@vN`, `loopdog-version: 'N'`). New
  installs already float. But repos scaffolded by an older Loopdog carry **exact**
  pins (`@<sha>` / `0.x.y`) that never move, and nothing re-synced them — `upgrade`
  only touched the `.loopdog/` config tree and `init` won't overwrite existing
  workflow files.

  `upgrade` now rewrites `.github/workflows/loopdog-*.yml` to the floating major
  (owner/repo, secrets, and trailing comments preserved; non-loopdog workflows and
  the custom deploy workflow untouched). It runs **even when the config is already
  current** — pin drift is independent of the config `version` — and honors
  `--dry-run`. One upgrade converts a legacy exact-pinned install to auto-tracking.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [#14](https://github.com/cmeyer90/loopdog/pull/14) [`080e520`](https://github.com/cmeyer90/loopdog/commit/080e520e5cbce682cb448b060c01fd13a7f224c0) Thanks [@cmeyer90](https://github.com/cmeyer90)! - Add `loopdog workflows` to manage the GitHub Actions workflows that drive the
  controller, so a disabled `loopdog-events`/`loopdog-sweep` no longer silently
  stalls the pipeline with no obvious cause.

  - `loopdog workflows` (alias `wf`) lists loopdog's workflows and whether each is
    enabled (`--all` to include the repo's own workflows, `--json` for machine
    output).
  - `loopdog workflows enable [names…]` / `disable [names…]` flip them on/off.
    With no names it targets only loopdog-owned workflows (your `ci` is never
    touched unless named); names accept `events`, `loopdog-events`, or
    `loopdog-events.yml`. Idempotent.
  - `loopdog init` now best-effort re-enables already-registered loopdog workflows
    on attach and points at `loopdog workflows` in its next steps. Safe-by-default
    means dry-run loops, not a switched-off controller.

  Implemented as a new `WorkflowsPort` capability on the GitHub port
  (`listWorkflows`/`enableWorkflow`/`disableWorkflow`) in both the Octokit and
  in-memory ports. Enable/disable use the operator's `gh`/token (needs
  `actions:write`), never the runtime `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- [#12](https://github.com/cmeyer90/loopdog/pull/12) [`b5dc48e`](https://github.com/cmeyer90/loopdog/commit/b5dc48e9f33bf9aa090be6f8782819d7c957ce8e) Thanks [@cmeyer90](https://github.com/cmeyer90)! - Fix plan-store fragmentation surfaced by an end-to-end dogfood — one issue must
  yield exactly one durable plan, bound to the source issue:

  - **Idempotent plan creation per issue.** `bindIssue` now scans the `Issue:`
    field for an existing plan before minting a new task id, so concurrent triage
    triggers reuse the one plan instead of racing to create duplicate stubs. The
    scan is shared with `resolveBinding` and matches `#N` exactly, so `#2` no
    longer collides with `#20`.
  - **Implement/review reuse the issue's plan, never a PR-bound one.**
    `syncPlanAfterTransition` resolves a pull-request item back to its linked
    source issue, so review/merge loops update the issue's plan (its `Issue:`
    field stays the source issue) instead of minting a plan numbered after the PR.
    A PR with no linked issue is skipped rather than misbound.
  - **Groomed criteria _and_ scope propagate into the durable plan.** Scope now
    carries from the issue body (loopdog's canonical source) into the plan via the
    new `parseScopeBlock`, joining the acceptance criteria that already did — so
    the loops that read the plan see the same acceptance bar humans groomed on the
    issue.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- [#8](https://github.com/cmeyer90/loopdog/pull/8) [`a7a012e`](https://github.com/cmeyer90/loopdog/commit/a7a012e0ea77767f4f5bbf871a5c58de23683d8c) Thanks [@cmeyer90](https://github.com/cmeyer90)! - Fix the zero-infra Actions install path, surfaced by an end-to-end dogfood:

  - **Claims no longer strand items.** Assigning the cosmetic "someone's on it"
    bot/agent is now best-effort — an Actions installation token can't assign
    agents, and that failure used to abort the claim between marker and lease,
    failing every `act`-mode transition (including deterministic triage).
  - **Caller workflows grant the permissions the reusable workflow needs**
    (`contents: write`, `checks: read`); under-granting caused a `startup_failure`.
  - **`workflow_call` secrets use valid underscore names** (`claude_fire_url`,
    `claude_fire_token`, `codex_mention_token`) — hyphenated secret names are
    rejected by GitHub and broke the caller at startup. The reusable event/sweep
    workflows now forward these to the controller as env so `act`-mode dispatch
    actually authenticates.
  - **Comment/plan-update results now ingest on the subscription path.** A Claude
    routine posts as the _user_, not a bot, so the old correlation (which required
    a `Bot` author) never matched groom/review results and they timed out. Ingest
    is now author-agnostic and keys on the `loopdog-verdict:` line (the dispatch
    marker, which also carries the run trailer, is no longer mistaken for the
    result). The brief now also tells the work cell to trail its summary comment.
  - **Review verdicts in a formal PR review now ingest.** A reviewer naturally
    submits a GitHub PR review (not an issue comment); correlation now also scans
    `listReviews` for the verdict, plumbing it through `IngestResult.verdict`.
  - **The Claude `/fire` backend maps known errors to fixes** —
    `github_repo_access_denied`, `authentication_error`, and 429 now produce a
    one-line actionable message instead of a bare HTTP status.
  - **`init` and `config validate` align their tables** to content width.
